# productivity-spreadsheet
This Google App Script automates the construction of a spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my productivity -- particularly how many days I spend working on a task each month.

You can see a demo of the app in action [over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKOPb9NWJds).
